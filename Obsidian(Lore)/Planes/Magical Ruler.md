An untamed plane has vast potential but it is directly tied to the life force of the magical ruler. If the MR has been killed, and only if they are killed, the plane dissolve into the ether of the cosmos. The plane "above" and "below" come together to annihilate the in between plane, which squeezes the energy released into the layers above and below, with the majority being exuded into the ether for reuse by the mechanisms of the universe.

No plane has ever been recorded as having been created. Every known plane has been discovered, and not created. That leads into an assumption that the MR's cannot be created, due to the fundamental link between the two. MR's do not have true individuality or self awareness. 

Fractions of the MR can have such qualities but are much rarer and generally are not long lived. 

A Magical Ruler is the plane, their "bones" make up the structure of the plane and their "organs" supply the plane with life..

Planes have been found that are completely barren and devoid of life and seemingly all magic, but the ruler still lives, somehow. A hibernation of sort? Not technically dead, as resources and materials can still be taken from the sleeping ruler.

To subjugate a MR one must enter their plane and complete a task of some sort. Due to habit, tradition, and ritual, the intelligent life forgo this and simply seek the Confluence. 

Every MR has a confluence, as it serves as the heart of such a being. Invading the Confluence of a ruler activates a defensive response and summons as full of an image of the ruler as possible. The plane will temporarily wither while the energy from it is gathered at the confluence. The amount of energy gathered is proportional to how strong this avatar of the ruler will be. After enough damage has been done to the avatar, the form will dissipate and leave behind either a material or an organic relic. This relic is used to control the plane and to transform it into a realm. 

A physical ruler will never been as in touch with a plane as a MR so their control is similarly impaired. They are not truly everywhere or all seeing or all powerful, as a MR could be. Over time PR's can gain much skill in controlling their realms but regardless of skill, it is a monumental burden.  

After a physical ruler has acquired a relic, the magical ruler will attempt to wrest control back by reabsorbing the relic. The relic is not what gives the MR the ability to control the plane, but it does add what amounts to a superuser system. The relic allows the bearer to have their wishes attain a higher priority in the mechanisms of the plane. 

The relic also enables the use of "magic" (see [[Magic]] for more info) which is the main way in which the PR reshapes the plain into a realm of their desire.
