The planes are the separate slices of reality that are stacked to infinity. There is no end nor a beginning, not that anyone can find. There are rumors of a top, but that must be ridiculous, how can there be a top to infinity? 

The planes are ruled by a [[Physical Ruler]], and a [[Magical Ruler]], and are inhabited by [[Average Denizen]]'s. The physical ruler must subjugate the magical ruler to gain control of the plane. 

Once a magical ruler has been subjugated, the plane becomes tamed. Tamed planes will be referred to as realms. An example being if John the Hero subjugated Tormak the Unrivaled of the Plane of Torment, the tamed plane could be known as The Realm of the Unrivaled Hero.

If the magical ruler usurps control the realm will return to a wild and untamed state. If a physical ruler usurps control, the realm will be reformed to their wishes.
