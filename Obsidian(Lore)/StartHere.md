The setting of the game will take place in a universe shaped like a tower (inspired by SIU's Tower of God). I imagine it similarly to a layered cake as opposed to the tower system specifically, where the layers will be planes of existence that can be vast or tiny, according to the [[Plane Hierarchy]]. 

There is magic, but it is unable to be used like contemporary magic systems. Magic flows through the fabric of the universe, as fundamental a force as gravity. See [[Magic]] and [[Great Cycle]] for details

The three main classes of denizens are (more can be added which is why 4 is left open)
1. [[Magical Ruler]]
2. [[Physical Ruler]]
3. [[Average Denizen]]
4. 



The "sane man" referred to in "The collected Ravings" folder is myself. I am allowed to be a little selfish as i am the one making the game. While there is a self insert character, I do not intend to have him serve as a direct plot catalyst. Perhaps making a small cameo somewhere, it will not be during the story. I intend this to be an in universe developers commentary of sorts. Something fun to add information i might not be able to squeeze in elsewhere. Some writings might serve as an introduction of sorts to the world. I intend to add a folder of accouterments and supplemental material to the finished work to help flesh out things more, for subsequent play through's, and to help reach obscure content. I would like to include several gamemodes, mostly variations on a theme. While endless modes and such are probably not a good idea to implement with a text (mainly) based interface, I can see a new game plus mode, and perhaps an entire second story similar to negative bloodlines from the series Infinity Blade that would be reached by performing a sequence of actions during a tutorial maybe? To the point though, which is about the self insert, I will be collecting the various writings in the aforementioned folder in [[Emmo's Eureka's]].  Some of this lore will be written in universe and some will break into reality as needed to make sense of everything. The style will be kept to be as readable as possible, since most things will condensed into a lore compendium for inclusion in supplemental material, which will prune most of my own commentary or out of universe ramblings from the finished piece.  Emmo's Eureka's will be a fun mix but will stay believable for in universe reasons.
