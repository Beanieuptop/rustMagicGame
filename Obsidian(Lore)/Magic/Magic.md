Magic is a fundamental force, as active and real and effective as gravity. A true constant that flows through the planes.  There are two main paths to progress. Physical modification, or use of a relic. Physical modification is split between mechanical modification and magical modification. Mechanical modification is replacing a hand with a cybernetic counterpart. Magical modification can come by growing an organ to perform a certain purpose, like electric shock and implanting that into the body, or by a magical influence altering the body to perform a certain task, like imbuing the power of flame into some one's hands by a fragment of the MR seeking reparations from the PR.

The [[Great Cycle]] of squalor to splendor to squalor again has led to a stagnation of the senses beyond the body. While a few average denizens might be able to see faint glimpses of the magic, even fewer can feel it at all, a simple low thrum might be heard at the faintest edges of perception every once in a blue moon, and even fewer yet can hold it tangibly. For an average denizen through enough hard work they might be able to light a candle, and subsequently put themselves in a coma. This is not a resistance thing, one cannot build up a tolerance from continued overuse. Only death awaits.
