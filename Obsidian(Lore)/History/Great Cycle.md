I am a fan of the Great Cycle conspiracy theory. Long story short it is the concept that there are cycles a civilization will go through, and that the ruins of the prior civilizations (relics, artifacts, technology, knowledge) help build these new civilizations up, only for them to fly too close to the metaphorical sun and lead to their own doom. Time and time again, repeated over and over and over ad nauseam ad infinitum.
